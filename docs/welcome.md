# Welcome to Shimmer

Shimmer is a decentralized ledger with the support of NFTs, native tokens, and smart contracts. This is an innovation network where the community tries out the new protocol changes before deploying them on the more conservative [IOTA network](https://wiki.iota.org). It has its own supply of tokens which are called $SMR.

In Shimmer, blocks form the [Tangle](./explanations/ledger/tangle.md), a parallel structure where multiple blocks can attach to different points at the same time and indepenedently. This structure scales better than blockchains where blocks attach strictly one after another. Blocks consume existing unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) and generate new ones. Depending on the output type, this might represent a [monetary transaction](./explanations/ledger/simple_transfers.md), an [NFT](./explanations/ledger/nft.md) ownership transaction, or an update of a [factory](./explanations/ledger/foundry.md) or a [smart contract chain](./explanations/what_is_stardust/sc_support.md) state.
